# AGRU4REC

Audio-Based GRU4REC (AGRU4REC) is an audio-based recommendation model designed for predicting the upcoming track within a listening session, given the audio associated with the current track. 

The code is based on [GRU4REC-PyTorch](https://github.com/hungthanhpham94/GRU4REC-pytorch) implemented by Phạm Thanh Hùng (hungthanhpham94), and the CNN is based on [Sample-level Deep CNN](https://github.com/kyungyunlee/sampleCNN-pytorch) implemented by Kyungyun Lee (kyungyunlee).
